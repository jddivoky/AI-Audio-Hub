# Overview/Main Stuff
The website for this project can be found [here](https://ai-audio-hub.web.app/ "AI Audio Hub Signup/Log in Page").
You can make free accounts right now, and later there will be a paid feature.
##### *I might add more paid features later.*

###### *There's not really a reason to use the website right now, as I haven't even finished it, and I still have to make the device for this. (Feel free to sign up though)*
